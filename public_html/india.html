<!-- <p> The India-Pakistan cricket rivalry is one of the most intense sports rivalries in the world.[1][2] 
	An India-Pakistan cricket match has been estimated to attract up to three hundred million television viewers 
	according to TV ratings firm Initiative. The 2011 World Cup Semifinal attracted around 1.5 billion TV viewers,
	the largest television event of the year.

	The arch-rival relations between the two nations, resulting from the extensive communal violence and conflict 
	that marked the partition of India into India and Pakistan in 1947 and the subsequent Kashmir conflict, laid 
	the foundations for the emergence of an intense sporting rivalry between the two nations who had erstwhile shared 
	a common cricketing heritage. The first Test series took place in 1951-52, when Pakistan toured India. India toured 
	Pakistan for the first time in 1954-55. Between 1962-77, no cricket was played between the two countries owing to two 
	major wars in 1965 and 1971. The 1999 Kargil War and the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks have also interrupted cricketing ties between the two nations.

	The growth of large expatriate populations from India and Pakistan across the world led to neutral states like the
	United Arab Emirates and Canada hosting several bilateral and multi-lateral ODI series involving the two teams. 
	Players in both teams routinely face intense pressure to win, and are threatened by extreme reactions in defeat.
	Extreme fan reactions to defeats in key matches such as in the ICC Cricket World Cup have been recorded, with a
	limited degree of violence and public disturbances. At the same time, India-Pakistan cricket matches have also offered 
	opportunities for cricket diplomacy as a means to improve relations between the two countries by allowing heads of state to 
	exchange visits and cricket followers from either country to travel to the other to watch the matches.
